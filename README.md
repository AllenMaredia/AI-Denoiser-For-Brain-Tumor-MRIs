# About

Training a U-net and autoencoder model to denoise MRIs of glioma tumors.

Packages needed:

-Numpy

-Matplotlib

-Scikitlearn

-Tensorflow

-PIL

-Tkinter


Execution Instructions:

-Download the files to train the models and run (UNetTrain.py, AutoEncoderTrain.py)

-Download the dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset/code

-Configure the path of the training set within the two training files and run the file to create the two models

-Configure the path of created models inside the AIDenoisingUNET.py file along with the AIDenoisingAutoEncoder.py file

-Run the file, select an MRI image from the testing set, and view the results
